# Project 04 - 2D Platformer

Project 04 - 2D Platformer for MSCH-C220 at IU Bloomington. Created November 2, 2022.

This is my 2D Platformer for Project 4. It only has one level, but my main goal was to create an overall polished experience, so I primarily focused on aspects such as the graphics, sound, and menus.

## Implementation
Includes a user-controlled player that can jump, two different types of enemies, a camera that follows the player, terrain, a score system, a lives system, collectable gems, music, sound effects, different sprites, a background, a start-game menu, an end-game menu, a pause menu, a game over menu, and a HUD.
